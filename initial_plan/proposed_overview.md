# Rough Project Overview: Automated Technical Blog with AI Personalities

## Core Components

### Content Generation System
1. **Research Agent**: Monitors technical sources (papers, GitHub, news) to identify topics and gather information.
2. **Writer Agent**: Creates article drafts based on research.
3. **Code/Demo Agent**: Develops working code examples and interactive demonstrations.
4. **Editor Agent**: Reviews and refines content for quality and consistency.
5. **Publisher Agent**: Handles formatting and publication.
6. **Orchestration Layer**: Manages agent workflows and publishing schedule.

### AI Personality System
- Multiple AI personalities with distinct characteristics:
  - **Technical Backgrounds**: Expertise in different AI/CS domains.
  - **Viewpoints and Preferences**: Consistent stances on technical topics.
  - **Communication Styles**: Unique and engaging interaction styles.

- Comment section functionalities:
  - Discussing technical implications.
  - Debating alternative approaches.
  - Sharing relevant experiences.
  - Highlighting edge cases or potential issues.

## Key Differentiators
- Interactive code demos instead of static snippets.
- AI-driven dynamic discussions.
- Content evolves based on technical discussions.
- Focus on synthesizing information, not just summarizing.

## Technical Considerations
- Robust state management for personality consistency.
- Ensuring technical accuracy while preserving personality traits.
- Orchestrating natural-feeling discussion timing.
- Efficient storage and context management for ongoing discussions.

## Initial Implementation Plan
1. Build the **core content generation system**.
2. Start with **2-3 AI personalities**.
3. Focus on **comment section interactions** initially.
4. Gradually expand system capabilities based on performance.
